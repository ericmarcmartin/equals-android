# Equals: Job Matching Mobile Application for Persons with Disabilities (PWDs)

**Equals** is an Android mobile application designed to help Persons With Disabilities (PWDs) find suitable job opportunities efficiently. The app aims to bridge the gap between employers and PWD job seekers by providing a user-friendly platform for job matching.

This app was deployed on the **Google Play Store**.  
You can watch a demo of the app here: [Equals Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcSYFyyEsbw)

## Overview

Equals was developed by **Eric Marc Martin**, **King Copones**, and **Roy Doria** as part of their Capstone Project at the **Technological Institute of the Philippines (TIP) in 2019**. The application focuses on inclusivity and accessibility, empowering PWD users to access employment opportunities with ease.

## Partnership

The project was done in partnership with **PHILCode** (The Philippine Council of Organizations on Disability and Empowerment), a non-profit umbrella organization in the Philippines. PHILCodeâ€™s member organizations provide programs and services that support persons with disabilities, including residential homes, livelihood opportunities, medical assistance, education, and advocacy for their inclusion in community services.

In addition, we partnered with multiple companies committed to inclusive hiring, allowing us to gather their contact details, job postings, and database access. These partnerships enabled us to provide real-time job opportunities for PWDs and streamline the communication between employers and job seekers.
