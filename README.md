# Equals: Job Matching Mobile Application for Persons with Disabilities (PWDs)

**Equals** is an Android mobile application designed to help Persons With Disabilities (PWD) find suitable job opportunities efficiently. The app aims to bridge the gap between employers and PWD job seekers by providing a user-friendly platform for job matching.

The project was done in partnership with **PHILCode** (The Philippine Council of Organizations on Disability and Empowerment), a non-profit umbrella organization in the Philippines. PHILCodeâ€™s member organizations provide programs and services that support persons with disabilities, including residential homes, livelihood opportunities, medical assistance, education, and advocacy for their inclusion in community services.
